# Integrated recovery validation, 2026-10-11

## Source and checks

Native source checkpoint: `8fe704068e300376b5040383c02e53de2c6f606c`.
The integrated release workspace passed 2,575 tests, with two ignored tests.
Strict release workspace/all-target Clippy, formatting and build passed.
The only build warning is upstream `block 0.1.6` future incompatibility.
All tracked shell scripts also pass ShellCheck. The two native-platform CI
Clippy failures and the Codex wrapper ShellCheck failures from `e6e04d75`
are corrected in this checkpoint; CI must verify the newer toolchain separately.

## Owned macOS acceptance

The isolated bundle contains seven signed executable helpers and passed deep
strict code-signature verification. Both source revision plist keys identify
`8fe70406`. Only the test bundle and its own profile were updated.

Actual automatic grouping shows one repository header containing both restored
shell tabs, with the repository branch chip. ANSI colors, bold, italic,
underline, combining accents, emoji sequences, flag and wide CJK characters
are visible in the owned window capture. Default grouping remains Off, matching
current Swift; this test profile explicitly uses Auto.

Real MCP performance snapshots expose both initial renderer registrations.
The selected terminal reports requested and actual GPU rendering. A separate
launch with the owned CPU preference reports requested and actual CPU drawing,
8,989,056 cached bitmap bytes and 35,627 CPU glyph-cache bytes. Its native
capture preserves the same styled Unicode fixture and repository grouping.
This proves both selectable terminal backends on this Metal-capable Mac;
automatic startup fallback on a Mac without Metal remains unsupported. The hidden,
never-painted view reports null actual renderer rather than inventing evidence.
Measured grid/string capacities and explicit native-ring estimates appear per
pane; private GPU and pending-native-image allocations remain unavailable.
Interactive focus and hidden/background refresh states are reported explicitly.
No hung-main-thread event occurred during these captures.

## Idle observation and limits

Baseline `e6e04d75`: two idle shells, 231.041 seconds, 1.650 percent of one
logical CPU for the app process. PTY callbacks were about 43.61 Hz per shell.
Candidate `8fe70406`: readiness waiting is separately instrumented and does not
hold parser locks. A later 53.177-second interval recorded 513 callbacks across
both shells, about 9.65 Hz combined, compared with 87.22 Hz combined in the
baseline. This establishes fewer idle callbacks in these captures.

It does not establish an equivalent CPU benchmark: native focus changed during
the candidate interval, baseline focus was not instrumented, builds ran
concurrently, and the observation lengths differ. The candidate app measured
1.565 percent of one logical CPU in that interval. No general CPU improvement
or interactive input-latency result is claimed. Profiler wall-time includes
waiting and must not be interpreted as CPU consumption.

A further 287.999-second interval with both snapshots reporting no focus
recorded 2,793 callbacks (9.698 Hz combined) and 0.717 percent of one logical
CPU. The same comparison limits apply.

The evidence directory contains `native-e6e04d75-performance-{a,b}.json`,
`native-8fe70406-performance-{a,b,c,d}.json`, both grouping screenshots, the
candidate bundle manifest, and integrated test/Clippy/fmt/build logs. These
numeric diagnostics contain no terminal transcript. Live-provider notification,
manual drag, VoiceOver and paired-device acceptance remain separate checks.

## Subsequent source checkpoint

OSC9 shell context, Windows path portability, the explicitly approved paired
push-frame patch, current notification reconciliation, shared native process
monitoring and Usage diagnostics are integrated after the native checkpoint.
Their source checks and native acceptance must be recorded separately; the
8fe70406 bundle is not evidence for those newer source changes.
