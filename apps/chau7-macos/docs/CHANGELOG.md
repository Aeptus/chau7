# Changelog

All notable changes to Chau7 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Remote Live Activity State**: Chau7 now projects one authoritative remote AI activity over the remote-control channel so the iPhone client can render a native Live Activity / Dynamic Island state for the most relevant task
- **Isolated Test App Builder**: Added a dedicated isolated app build that runs with its own bundle ID, home root, keychain prefix, logs, and app support directories for safe manual testing alongside the main app
- **MCP Terminal Key Tools**: Added `tab_press_key` for real terminal key events and `tab_submit_prompt` as an Enter-key convenience for interactive TUIs like Claude Code
- **Tab Bar Staleness Detection**: Watchdog now detects when NSHostingView becomes disconnected (preference keys stop firing) and forces recovery
- **Clickable File Paths**: Cmd+Click on file paths in terminal output to open in right panel editor (planned)
- **Runtime Turn Send for Adopted Sessions**: MCP clients can now send prompts through `runtime_turn_send` even when the runtime session was adopted from an existing tab

### Fixed
- **Claude Code Prompt Submission via MCP**: `tab_send_input` remains raw text while the new keypress path now sends real Enter-style terminal input, fixing prompt submission in TUIs that distinguish pasted newlines from the Return key
- **Isolated Test App Startup**: Disabled notification-center initialization in isolated mode and corrected the embedded isolated-home launcher path to prevent startup crashes
- **AI Tool Detection**: Fixed false positive detecting "Cursor" on Codex sessions - patterns now more specific to avoid matching generic text like "cursor position"
- **Build Errors**: Fixed Swift 6 actor isolation error in `handleOutput()` and optional binding on non-optional Data
- **Tab Reordering Preview**: Fixed dragged tabs causing sibling tabs to slide early with a visible offset in the toolbar

### Changed
- **Queued Terminal Input Ordering**: Terminal sessions now preserve order between queued raw text input and queued key presses when a tab is created or restored before its view attaches
- **Runtime Path Isolation**: Chau7-owned paths and keychain service names can now be redirected through `RuntimeIsolation`, allowing safe test builds without touching the main app's storage
- **Output Detection Patterns**: Made patterns more specific (URLs with slashes, version strings, box-drawing banners) to reduce false positives

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- **Tab Notification Styling**: New `TabNotificationStyle` with color, italic, bold, pulse, and icon properties
  - Predefined styles: `.waiting`, `.error`, `.success`, `.attention`
  - Integration with notification action system (`styleTab` action type)
  - Auto-clear timer support with race condition prevention

- **Snippet Variable Improvements**:
  - Picker support: `${input:name:opt1|opt2|opt3}` for single-select dropdowns
  - Multi-select support: `${multiselect:name:opt1|opt2|opt3}` with toggle buttons
  - FlowLayout for multi-select buttons

- **Manual Tab Bar Recovery**: Window menu → "Refresh Tab Bar" (Cmd+Option+R)

### Fixed
- **Major Tab Bar Resilience** (4 architectural fixes):
  1. Cache NSHostingView in TabBarToolbarDelegate - prevents state loss on toolbar recreation
  2. Visibility-based recovery - detects "rendered but invisible" tabs via geometry
  3. Stable view identity with UnifiedTabButton - prevents SwiftUI view recreation
  4. Model-owned watchdog lifecycle - runs regardless of view lifecycle events

- **Debug Console**: Fixed empty logs issue - category filter now allows logs without tags
- **Snippet Variable Dialog**: Fixed crash from ForEach indices binding - uses identity-based bindings

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Tab Bar Watchdog**: Timer-based health monitoring with automatic recovery
  - Reports rendered tab count from view to model
  - Limits refresh attempts to 3 to prevent log spam
  - Thread-safe with `dispatchPrecondition`

- **Smart Scroll**: Preserves user's scroll position when new output arrives
  - Only auto-scrolls if user is at/near bottom of terminal
  - New `isSmartScrollEnabled` setting (default: true)

- **Enhanced Logging System** (`LogEnhanced`):
  - 11 categories: App, Tabs, Terminal, Session, Network, Performance, etc.
  - Structured JSON output option
  - Correlation IDs for async operation tracing
  - `PerfTracker` for performance measurement
  - Memory pressure monitoring
  - OSLog integration for Console.app

- **Debug Console Improvements**:
  - Level filter chips (TRACE, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
  - Category filter chips with emojis
  - Quick presets ("All", "Errors Only")
  - Entry counter and memory display

### Fixed
- **Tab Bar Crash**: Removed `.drawingGroup(opaque: false)` causing Metal render corruption
- **ProxyManager Concurrency**: Fixed race condition (DispatchQueue.global → .main)
- **14 Build Warnings**: Unused vars, var→let, discarded results

### Changed
- **Logging Defaults**: Restored critical logs from TRACE to INFO (dev server, AI detection, stuck detection)
- **FileTailer Buffer**: Increased from 1MB to 4MB for verbose Codex output
- **Stale Timeout**: Reduced from 600s to 180s (3 min) for faster session close detection
- **History Idle Notification**: Disabled by default (was noisy)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- **Tab Reordering**: Drag-and-drop tabs to reorder
- **Terminal Context Menu**: Right-click menu with common actions
- **Notification Event System**:
  - `ShellEventDetector` for shell events (exit codes, patterns, long-running commands)
  - `AppEventEmitter` for app events (scheduled, inactivity, memory pressure)
  - `NotificationActionExecutor` for executing trigger actions
  - Thread safety with serial queues and rate limiting
  - Memory hysteresis to prevent alert flooding

### Fixed
- **Terminal Focus**: Focus returns to terminal after snippet selection
- **Git Badge**: Fixed git icon/branch not showing on new tabs - use `updateCurrentDirectory()` instead of direct property assignment
- **Text Selection Bugs**:
  - `lastSelectionText` not clearing when user clicks to deselect
  - Mouse state not cleared when mouseUp is outside bounds/window
  - Lowered drag threshold from 3px to 1.5px for better detection

### Changed
- Keyboard shortcut updates
